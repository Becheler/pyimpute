## Python module for geospatial prediction using scikit-learn and rasterio

`pyimpute` provides high-level python functions for bridging the gap between spatial data formats and machine learning software to facilitate supervised classification and regression on geospatial data. This allows you to create landscape-scale predictions based on sparse observations.

The observations, known as the **training data**, consists of:

* response variables: what we are trying to predict
* explanatory variables: variables which explain the spatial patterns of responses

The **target data** consists of explanatory variables represented by raster datasets. There are no response variables available for the target data; the goal is to *predict* a raster surface of responses. The responses can either be discrete (classification) or continuous (regression).

## Pyimpute Functions

* `load_training_vector`: Load training data where responses are vector data (explanatory variables are always raster)
* `load_training_raster`: Load training data where responses are raster data
* `stratified_sample_raster`: Random sampling of raster cells based on discrete classes
* `evaluate_clf`: Performs cross-validation and prints metrics to help tune your scikit-learn classifiers.
* `load_targets`: Loads target raster data into data structures required by scikit-learn
* `impute`: takes target data and your scikit-learn classifier and makes predictions, outputing GeoTiffs
    
These functions don't really provide any new functionality, it merely saves a lot of tedious data wrangling that would otherwise bog your analysis down in low level details. In other words, pyimpute simply provides a clean python workflow for spatial prediction, allowing us to:
* frequently update predictions with new information (e.g. new Landsat imagery as it becomes available)
* explore new variables more easily
* bring the technique to other disciplines and geographies

### Installation

Assuming you have `libgdal` installed, you can install with pip 

```
pip install pyimpute
```

Alternatively, grab the source code and go...
```
git clone https://github.com/perrygeo/pyimpute.git
cd pyimpute
pip install -e .
```


### The general process

1. Loading spatial data
	* Easiest method: import table containing training observations with both explanatory and response variables.  
	* Alternate method: perform random stratified sampling on a response data
	and generate training data from rasters
	* Another alternate method: Use python-rasters-stats to grab the data from explanatory rasters using point data

2. Fit a classification or regression model
	* Leverage scikit-learn classifiers or regressors
	* Fit to training data
	* optional: scale and optionally reduce dimensionality of data
	* optional: calibrate using grid search cv to find optimal parameters
	* optional: create your own ensemble [2]
	* Evaluate:
	    * crossvalidation (average score over k-folds)
	    * train_test split
	    * metrics  [3]
	    * confusion matrix
	    * compare to dummy estimators
	    * identify most informative features [1]
  
3. Generate spatial prediction from target data
	* scikit classifiers to make predictions and generate certainty estimates
	* GDAL to write predicted classes array to new raster
	* write raster of prediction probability for each pixel
	* write rasters (one for each class) with probability of that class over space

### Example

Please check out [the examples](https://github.com/perrygeo/python-impute/blob/master/examples/)

This example walks through the main steps of loading training data, setting up and evaluating a classifier, and using it to predict a raster of the response variable.

#### Note about performance and memory limitations
Depending on the classifier you use, memory and/or time might become limited.

The `impute` method takes an optional argument, (`linechunk`) which calibrates the performance. 
Specifically, it determines how many lines/rows of the raster file are processed at once. 

**tl;dr;** You want to set `linechunk` as high as possible without exceeding your memory capacity.

In this example, I use the RandomForest classifier. Other classifiers may exhibit different behavior
but, in general, there is a tradeoff between speed and memory;

as you increase `linechunk` memory increases *linearly*

while performance increases *exponentially*.

#### Note about geostatistics
While kriging and other geostatistical techniques are technically "geospatial prediction", they rely on spatial dependence between observations. The problems for which this module was built are landscape scale 
and rarely suited to such approaches. There is great potential to meld the two approaches (i.e. consider spatial autocorrelation between training data as well as explanatory variables) but this is currently outside the scope of this module.

The naming and core concept is based on the [yaImpute](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaImpute/index.html) R Package.
